# Lab 02 | Unit Testing with Node.js and Jest

## Overview

This lab focuses on applying **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, **unit testing**, and **mocking techniques** using **Node.js** and **Jest**. You'll build and test a calculator module, extend it with new features, and test an API client using mocking to simulate external dependencies.

### Objectives

By completing this lab, you'll gain hands-on experience with:

- Writing unit tests using **Jest**
- Applying **white-box** and **black-box** testing strategies
- Using **dependency injection** and **mocking** to isolate components
- Designing tests that trace back to requirements
- Understanding how software quality impacts users and security
